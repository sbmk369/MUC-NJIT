            I am originally from Elizabeth, New Jersey and am a recent graduate of Magnet High School in Scotch Plains. It was a vocational school focused in engineering, <br>
            but in my senior year I took a residential architecture course and realized I would rather go into a similar field rather than engineering. I am currently living on campus <br>
            in Cypress Hall. My favorite class at the moment is MATH105 because it's a different kind of math (statistics) that I never experienced in high school.
